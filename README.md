# OpenNyx: Your Fortress for Digital Privacy & Freedom
## üõ°Ô∏è Imagine a Place... where everything is fully encrypted, portable, and self-destructible.
Welcome to OpenNyx ‚Äì the visionary open-source operating system built from the ground up for ultimate privacy and digital freedom. Our mission is to create a secure, ephemeral, and truly private computing environment that leaves no digital footprint.
OpenNyx is designed to run directly from RAM, offering an unparalleled level of security and discretion.
## ‚ú® Key Concepts
 * Full Encryption: Every aspect of your digital environment, from the OS itself to your temporary data, is robustly encrypted at all times.
 * Maximum Portability: Carry your secure digital workspace with you on a USB drive or other portable media, ready to boot on almost any compatible hardware.
 * Self-Destruct on Demand ("Nuke" Function): Upon shutdown, or triggered by predefined events, OpenNyx securely and irrecoverably wipes all traces from RAM, ensuring no data residue is left behind.
 * Built for Ultimate Privacy: Designed with a privacy-first philosophy, minimizing telemetry and providing tools for digital anonymity.
 * Digital Freedom: Empowering users with control over their data and digital interactions, free from surveillance and censorship.
## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications (Early Considerations)
 * Core Operating System: Based on a hardened, minimalist Linux kernel distribution (e.g., Alpine Linux, Tiny Core Linux, or a custom-built kernel) to reduce attack surface and resource usage.
 * RAM-Based Operation: Utilizes tmpfs or ramfs for the root filesystem, potentially combined with overlayfs for a read-only base layer and a writable RAM overlay.
 * Encryption Mechanism:
   * Symmetric Encryption: AES-256 in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for all data encryption within RAM. GCM provides authenticated encryption, crucial for data integrity and confidentiality.
   * Key Derivation Function (KDF): Argon2id (recommended for password hashing and key derivation) or Scrypt for deriving strong, unique session keys from user passphrases or hardware tokens.
   * Hashing: SHA-3 (512-bit) for cryptographic hashing needs.
   * Hardware Acceleration: Leveraging AES-NI CPU instructions where available for optimal performance.
 * "Nuke" Function (Secure Data Wiping):
   * Mechanism: Kernel-level routine to perform multiple passes of random data overwrites across all accessible RAM segments (e.g., following principles similar to DoD 5220.22-M for data sanitization).
   * Triggers:
     * Manual activation via a dedicated command or GUI button.
     * Automatic execution on system shutdown.
     * Emergency triggers: USB device removal (from which OS booted), predefined inactivity timeout, multiple incorrect passcode entries, or an "alarm password" that initiates wipe instead of login.
 * Secure Boot: Integration with UEFI Secure Boot and potentially Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for verified boot integrity and sealed key storage.
 * Networking: Minimalistic network stack, with built-in support for VPNs and strong consideration for Tor/I2P integration.
 * Persistent Storage (None by Default): Strict enforcement that no data is written to any persistent storage by default. Users can explicitly mount external, encrypted volumes if required.
 * User Interface (Early Design Concept):
   * Aesthetics: Functional, minimalist, and dark-themed. Designed for efficiency with minimal visual clutter or animations.
   * Usability: Intuitive navigation with clear visual indicators for encryption status and active "Nuke" triggers.
   * Key Elements: A discreet status bar showing network connectivity, encryption status, and CPU/RAM usage. A clearly identifiable but non-intrusive "Nuke" option.
   * Color Scheme: A limited palette, primarily dark greys and blacks with high-contrast accents: Green (Secure/Active), Red (Warning/Nuke Trigger), Blue (Informational).
   * Typography: Preference for clear, monospaced fonts for readability and technical aesthetics.
## üöÄ Join the Mission!
We are at the foundational stage of building OpenNyx, and this ambitious project requires a passionate and skilled community. If you believe in a future of true digital privacy and freedom, we invite you to join us!
üî≠ Roadmap Highlights
Our journey to OpenNyx will proceed through several key phases:
 * Phase 0: Conception & Initial Setup: Defining core principles, setting up project infrastructure (Git, Discord), and building the early community.
 * Phase 1: Proof of Concept & Kernel Foundations: Developing a minimal, bootable kernel running from RAM, with rudimentary encryption and self-destruction demos.
 * Phase 2: Functional Prototype & Security Architecture: Expanding kernel capabilities, implementing robust cryptographic subsystems, and establishing reliable self-wiping mechanisms.
 * Phase 3: Advanced Features & Stability: Integrating advanced features like anonymizing networks, refining hardware compatibility, and extensive testing.
 * Phase 4: Initial Release & Community Growth: Launching the first stable version of OpenNyx and expanding our user and contributor base.
